1. Add Vertex
Function Prototype:
 void Graph::addVertex(string)

 Function Description:
 This method takes in a name for a landmark and checks to make sure a vertex has not   already been associate with that name. If it has not, it will create
 a new vertex with the name and add it to the vertices vector

 Example:
 Graph g;
 g.addVector("Eiffel Tower");
 
 Expected Input: String for a landmark (string)
 
 Expected Output: There are no outputs, but a vertex will be created and added to the vertices struct. If the name for the landmark has already been found, the program will display that the landmark was found.

 Precondition: Vector class must be included. The string parameter has no extra spaces, and is the correct name of the landmark. The struct vertex has been declared with all corresponding variables.
 The vertices vector has been declared.

 Postcondition: The string name given will be created into a vertex and added to the vertices vector. If the name was already created as a vector the program will say that name was found.

2. Add Edge
 Function Prototype:
 void Graph::addEdge(string, string, int)

 Function Description:
 This method takes in two names for landmarks, finds if the two names correspond to vertices, and adds an edge between
 the vertices with the corresponding parameter for weight.

 Example:
 Graph g;
 g.addEdge("Eiffel Tower", "Taj Mahal", 2000);
 
 Expected Input: Two strings for two landmarks where an edge needs to be added and an integer for the weight of the edge.
 
 Expected Output: No expected outputs. The edge will be created and the adjacent vertices vector will be updated with an adjacent vertex in both directions.

 Precondition: Vector class must be included. The vertices vector and the adjacent vector have been declared. The struct for adjVertex has been initialized with a pointer to the vector and the weight.
 If no landmarks have been added to the vertices vector, then v1 and v2 will not be found. The starting landmark is string v1 and the ending landmark is v2.
 The weight between the landmarks will be given by int weight. All this information can be found in the generated text file.

 Postcondition: An edge will be added between the two vertices with the corresponding weight. The adjacent vector for v1 will have v2 added, and the adjacent vector
 for v2 will have v1 added. The edge will be created in both directions.

3. Breadth First Search
Function Prototype:
 void Graph::breadthFirstSearch(string, string)

5. Depth First Traversal Recursive
Function Prototype:
 void Graph::depthFirstTraversalRecursive(string)

 Function Description: This method prints all the vertices according to the 'depth first' recursive traversal procedure. Depth first prints out the vertices in the graph
 by going deeper into the graph rather than side-by-side or breadth first.

 Example:
 Graph g;
 g.depthFirstTraversalRecursive("Eiffel Tower");
 
 Expected Input: One string to represent the starting landmark of the traversal

6. Search
Function Prototype:
 void Graph::search(vertex)

 Function Description: This method prints all the adjacent vertices according to the 'depth first' recursive traversal procedure

 Example:
 Graph g;
 search(*startingLandmark->adj[i].v) [This is a private method so it does not need to be called from graph g]
 
 Expected Input: A vertex from the depth-first recursive traversal method which will be used to continue printing the vertices depth first.
 
 Expected Output: The vertices names in order of the recursive depth-first traversal with district ID's.

7. Breadth First Traversal
Function Prototype:
 void Graph::breadthFirstTraversal(string)

 Function Description: This method prints all the vertices according to the 'breadth first' traversal procedure which traverses the tree side-by-side rather
 than depth first.

9. Find Districts
Function Prototype:
 void Graph::findDistricts(string)

 Function Description: This method will assign all landmarks a district. Initially, all landmarks are connect, so they will have the same district, however,
 some landmarks may be deleted.

 Example:
 Graph g;
 g.findDistricts("Golden Gate Bridge");
 
 Expected Input: String which will be used to start the traversal assigning all landmarks a district. It does not matter which landmark is the parameter,
 as long as the landmark exists. The traversal algorithm will find all landmarks, even if they are not connected.
